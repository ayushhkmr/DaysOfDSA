// There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle 
// and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise 
// from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving 
// clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.

// The rules of the game are as follows:

// Start at the 1st friend.
// Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend 
// you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
// The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
// If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting 
// from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
// Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.
// Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.

Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:
1) Start at friend 1.
2) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.
3) Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
4) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.
5) Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.
6) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.
7) Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.
8) Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.
9) Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.
